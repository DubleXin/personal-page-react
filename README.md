# Personal Page

This is the initial version of my personal portfolio website.  
All main sections are implemented and connected to the backend, with base styling in place.

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- Sanity CMS (backend)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Axios for data fetching

## Next Steps
- Refine final styles and responsiveness
- Optimize image loading and transitions
- Add README visuals and live demo link
